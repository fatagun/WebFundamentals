						<h3>Brief history of HTTP</h3>
					</section>

					<section>
						<div>
							Initial specs of HTTP was very simple. <br />
							<img src="images/originalhttp.png" />
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>HTTP 0.9: One line protocol</h3>
						<div>
							HTTP/0.9 was <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1945.txt">released</a> in 1991 by Tim Barnes Lee. <br />
							It was a text based request, response protocol. <br />
							Only HTML was supported.<br />
							After each request; connection was terminated. <br />
						</div>
					</section>

						<h3>HTTP 0.9</h3>
						<div>
							<img src="images/http09.PNG" style="text-align: center;" />
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>HTTP/1.0 : Rapid growth</h3>
						<div>
							Later on, HTTP/0.9 was <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945">extended</a> to HTTP/1.0, request and response headers were added, also, you request images, text files, CSS and other. Every connection required a 3 way handshake which was very wasteful. 
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>HTTP 1.0</h3>
						<div>
							<img src="images/http10.PNG" />
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>HTTP/1.1 : Internet Standard</h3>
						<div>
							In 1999, HTTP/1.1 was <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html">released</a>.<br /> 
							Persistent connections (keep alive) was introduced (which eliminated 3 way handshake for every request), chunked transfer encoding and host header were added. <br />
							With host headers, it was possible to host multiple sites for an IP. It was a breakthrough. <br />

						<h3>HTTP/2.0 : Improving Transport Performance</h3>
						<div>
							It was 2015 when HTTP/2 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540">released</a> with several enhancements to prior versions, mostly targeting performance and common HTTP/1.1 problems.

						<h3>Request/Response Model</h3>
						<div>
							Client communicates with the server using messages (request and response message).<br />
							Every request gets a response. Client sends a request and server returns a response. <br />
							This is also called a HTTP transaction.

						<h3>Content Negotiation</h3>
					</section>

					<section>
						<div>
							Content negotiation refers to mechanisms defined as a part of HTTP that make it possible to serve different versions of a document (or more generally, representations of a resource) at the same URI, so that user agents can specify which version fits their capabilities the best.
						</div>

						<h3>Headers</h3>
					</section>

					<section>
						<div>
							There are 4 types of HTTP headers:<br/>
							General Headers: date, connection etc. Used by both clients and server.<br/>
							Request Headers: Used by client to indicate client configuration.<br/>
							Response Headers: used by servers to describe server configuration and URL's information.<br/>
							Entity Headers: Used by servers to describe entities, resources. <br/>

					<section>
						<div>
							The internet consists of 5 layers of OSI model. <br />
							Everything runs on transport layer which for HTTP is TCP.
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<img src="images/reliability_of_tcp.PNG" />
					</section>

					<section>
						<div>
							A packet or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP</a> packet in specific, is series of bytes, encapsulated in a format or data structure called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_(networking)">frame</a>. Frames contain several information such as how long the packet is, how it should be delivered, where it is coming from and going to. <strong>A packet's payload can effectively contain 1460 bytes at most</strong>.
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<div>
							 Slow start is used to detect the current state of the network. If there is a congestion in the network, new connections shouldn't make it worse. Slow start allows the sender to send additional unacknowledged packet for every acknowledged packet it receives.  This means that after initial connection, and one acknowledged packet, sender sends two, after getting acknowledgement for two packets, sender can send four and so on. 
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<div>
							 This geometric growth soon reaches an upper limit defined in the protocol at which point the connection will enter what is called the <strong>congestion avoidance phase</strong>.
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<div>
							It usually takes a few round trips to get the optimal congestion window size which are very precious to determine the performance. Usually operating systems start with 4 packets which makes 5840 bytes for initial congestion window size which sender needs to wait for acknowledgements.
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<div>
							Today, web pages have size of 2MB of data including images, css, js and other files. In a perfect network conditions, it takes around 9 round trips to transmit the data to the client.
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<div>
							Browsers commonly opens up six connections to a particular host. Congestion window needs to occur six times in parallel. TCP will make sure that those connections play nicely together, but it does not guarantee that their performance will be optimal.
						</div>
					</section>

					<section> 
						<div>
							TCP Provides reliability and ordering. <br />
							Avoid congestion with flow control.

						<h3>HTTP Compression</h3>
					</section>

					<section>
						<div>
							Compression helps reduce bandwidth usage and transfer size/speed. 
							<br/>
							HTTP compression is enabled on server side and client should support it.<br/>
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<div>
							Request-Header : Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate <br/>
							Response-Header: Content-Encoding: gzip, deflate <br />
							Other compression types: ie brotli, protobuf is available.

						<h3>Important HTTP Concepts</h3>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Latency</h3>
						<div>
							<img src="images/latency.png" />
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<div>How long it takes for an IP packet to get from one location to another. Round trip time (RTT) is twice the latency. Latency is the major bottleneck for HTTP which uses many round trips to the server.
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Bandwidth</h3>
						<div>
							<img src="images/bandwidth.png" />
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<div>
							Connection between two locations, can handle only so much data at a time before it is saturated. Bandwidth can be bottleneck depending on the amount of data and the capacity of the connection.
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Connection Time</h3>
						<div>
							Establishing a connection requires a Round trip between the client and the server called the “Three Way Handshake.” This handshake time is generally related to the latency between the client and the server.
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>TLS negotiation time</h3>
						<div>
							If the client is making an HTTPS connection, it needs to negotiate Transport Layer Security (TLS) the successor to Secure Socket Layer (SSL). This involves more round trips on top of server and client processing time.
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>TTFB – Time to first byte</h3>
						<div>
							 Time to first byte is the time passed from a client request to start receiving the response from the server. It is the sum of DNS lookup, Connection setup, TLS handshake.
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>TTLB - Time to last byte</h3>
						<div>
							<strong>Content Download time, time to last byte or TTLB:</strong> This is the time for all the content to complete downloading to client.
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Start Render Time</h3>
						<div>
							This is the time when user start seeing something on the browser, or browser starts paint process.
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Document Complete, Page Load Time</h3>
						<div>
							 This is the duration which is considered client completely downloaded the page and rendered it.
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>DNS lookup</h3>
						<div>
							Before a client can fetch a web page it needs to translate the hostname to an IP address using the Domain Name System (DNS). This needs to happen for every unique hostname on the fetched HTML page as well, though luckily only once per hostname and this information can be cached.
						</div>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h3>Session and Cookies</h3>
					</section>

					<section>
						<div>
							By default HTTP is stateless, session ,cookies and some browser support enables storing state.
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Cookies</h3>
						<div>Cookies are small piece of data (in the shape of key value pairs) stored on the browser and sent to server via request headers per each request. In HTTP/1.1 Headers are not compressed so keeping cookies small is important.</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Web/HTTP Session</h3>
						<div>
							Web/HTTP session is created in server and identified by a unique key (session id). Session is a data storage (hash table/dictionary) that contains data in key/value pair. 
						</div>
					</section>

					<section> 
						<div>
							User session contains information about user across multiple HTTP requests.Session ID can be stored in cookies or URL.
						</div>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h3>Performance Optimization</h3>
					</section>

					<section>
						<div>
							<ul>
								<li>Reducing number of HTTP requests</li>
								<li>Client side caching</li>
								<li>Domain sharding</li>
								<li>Bundling and minification</li>
								<li>DNS prefetch/resource hints</li>
								<li>Image Striping</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Reducing number of HTTP requests</h3>
						<div>
							This is the most important in performance. The more HTTP requests, the slower you page is. 
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Client Side Caching</h3>
						<div>
							Nothing is faster than serving resources from the client's machine. No network resources will be used.
							<br />
							Client side caching TTL can be set through the HTTP header <strong>“cache control”</strong> and the key <strong>“max-age” (in seconds)</strong>, or the <strong>“expires”</strong> header.
							<br />
							Static content like images, JS, CSS and other files can be versioned. Once the version changes, client makes a request to get the newer version from the server.
							<br />
							https://foo.com/styles.css?<strong>v=342</strong>
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Domain Sharding</h3>
						<div> 
							<ul>
								<
								<li>Requests more resources.</li>
								<li>Requires more DNS lookups.</li>
								<li></li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Bundling and minification</h3>
						<div>
							Bundling and minification is good for reducing HTTP requests, which will have positive impact on the performance. <br />
							CSS and JS can benefit from bundling and minification. Also, you can minify HTML content.
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>DNS prefetch/resource hints</h3>
						<div>
							Typically DNS is queried once the browser completes rendering HTML.<br />

							DNS prefetch and resourse hints tell the browser to resolve DNS to HTML rendering. <br />

						<h3>Multiple Connections</h3>

						<div>
							When the app requires 50+ HTTP requests, there is a limit to the number of connections a browser can open per host, most browsers support 6 connections simultaneously.
						 	<br />
							Establishing a connection requires 3 way handshake.
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Lack of prioritization:</h3>
						<div>
							Priority is decided by browser. Not be developer or the application. There is no way to specify the order or responses. Browsers need to decide how to best use the connections and the order of resources.
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Verbose Headers</h3>
						<div>
							There is no header compression. Headers, cookies send to the server for every request which is inefficient especially for very high volume sites.
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Head of line blocking</h3>
						<div>
							Once the connection is created, it is dedicated for specific request, until the response comes back, it cannot be used. ie: If you need to get 30 resources from host, you can get 6 at a time. Once you request 6 resources, the others must wait for these 6 requests to finish. So, HTTP/1.1 works in a serial way (serial request and response). This is called Head of line blocking.

						<h3>Common Problems with Web Applications</h3>
					</section>

					<section>
						<div>
							<strong>#1: Big systems fail more often than small systems.</strong> Big systems have more external and internal dependencies along with many moving parts. Therefore, big systems should have many defensive mechanisms in place.
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<div>
							<strong>#2: Blocked threads are the number one cause of most failures.</strong>Slow applications and hung threads are the most popular reasons of failures. These reasons lead to cascading failures and chain reactions. Blocked/hung threads can happen due to several reasons like deadlocks, starvation and live locks. Hung thread detection policies, timeouts, circuit breakers and bulkheads can prevent these failures.
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<div>
							<strong>#3: Integration points are number one killer in any system.</strong>. Every integration point eventually fails, however a failure in the integration point shouldn’t take down the whole application. Cascading failures occur when problems in one integration point propagates. Failures in integrated services becomes your problem. It even become more serious if you are not prepared for it.
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<div>
							<strong>#4: Tight coupled systems fail more often than loose coupled systems.</strong> Decoupling middleware is a good practice to enable loose coupling for integration. This principle is applicable and best practice for cloud native applications.
						</div>
					</section>
					
					<section>
						<div>
							<strong>#5: High traffic site's Resource/Connections pools get drained very quickly.</strong> Resource/Connection pool have limitations. They can run out of resources rapidly and application performance will start degrading.
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<div>
							<strong>#6: Unbalanced capacities causes failures and scalability problems for applications.</strong>If the capacities are not aligned, then you have a problem. Capacity and sizing should be planned accordingly.
						</div>
					</section>
					
					<section>
						<div>
							<strong>#7: Never trust a system you have no control over.</strong> The downstream application which is running a blocking code, can take your application down.
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<div>
							<strong>#8: Slow applications gets more traffic.</strong>
							When an application is slow, users hit re-load button or F5 many times to reach to the application which causes more traffic.
						</div>
					</section>
					
					<section>
						<div>
							<strong>#9: Fail fast all the time and retry gradually.</strong>
							Exponential back off, Circuit breakers and timeouts should be embraced. User friendly error codes or default messages should be presented to the user until the stability is established.
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<div>
							<strong>#10: Appreciate your hardware resources and utilize them wisely.</strong>. <br />
							Don't fall for CPU and Memory is CHEAP. This is not TRUE. Long running CPU cycles can cause contention which slows down your application and eventually it will fail. Paged or unfragmented memory causes slow seek times.</div>

						<h3>Performance evaluation</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<div>
							<ul>
							 	<li>Latency Test - Measures end to end transaction time.</li>
							 	<li>Throughput Test - Measures number of concurrent transactions a system can handle.</li>
							 	<li>Load Test - a boolean test, if the system can handle the load or not.</li>
							 	<li>Stress Test - Finds out the breaking point of a system.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<div>
							<ul>
							 	<li>Endurance Test - Measures if there are any anomalies during tests.</li>
							 	<li>Capacity Planning Test - Made to find out whether the system performs as expected based on capacity planning and provisioning.</li>
							 	<li>Degradation Test - Made to find out when the system performance degrades.</li>
							</ul>
